[![NPM version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/pdb-residue-interactions.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/pdb-residue-interactions) 

This is a component based on the residue contacts viewer in [Protein Contacts Atlas](https://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/rajini/index.html). It displays, in graphical form, the atomic contacts between each of the secondary structural elements (helices and sheets) in a protein. The broader the connection between each of the secondary structural elements, the more atomic contacts are involved in the interface. Hovering over these connections will display the exact number of atomic contacts in this interaction.
